          In JavaScript, <b>var, const, and let</b> are all used for declaring variables, but they have some differences
          in
          terms of scope, hoisting, and mutability. <br>
          <hr>
          - With the <b>var keyword,</b> variable names are redeclarable and reassignable. <br>
          - With the <b>let keyword,</b> variable names are reassignable; we can change the value in the future in an
          application
          of a let variable. <br>
          - With the <b>const keyword,</b> variable names are fixed and can't be redeclared or reassigned. When we want
          to make a
          variable fixed and never change, we use the const keyword. <br>
          <hr>
          <b style="color: red;">var</b> is function-scoped, meaning it is limited in scope to the function in which it
          is declared or the global scope if declared outside of any function. <br>
          - Variables declared with var <b>can be re-declared and updated</b> within their scope. <br>
          - Variables declared with <b>var are hoisted</b> to the top of their scope. <br>
          <hr>
          <b style="color: red;">let</b> is block-scoped, meaning it is limited in scope to the block ({}) in which it
          is declared. <br>
          - Variables declared with let can be <b>updated but not re-declared</b> within their scope. <br>
          - Variables declared with let are hoisted to the top of their block but <b>not initialized</b> until their
          declaration is evaluated. <br>
          <hr>
          <b style="color: red;">const</b> is also block-scoped like let. <br>
          - Variables declared with const <b>cannot be re-assigned</b> once initialized. However, for objects and
          arrays, their properties or elements can be modified. <br>
          - Variables declared with const are also hoisted but <b>not initialized</b> until their declaration is
          evaluated. <br>
          <hr>
          <span style="color: blue; text-align: center; display: block;">Using const is preferable when you don't intend
            to reassign a variable. It helps in writing more predictable and maintainable code. let is useful when you
            need to reassign variables. var is still used in older codebases, but let and const are preferred in modern
            JavaScript development due to their more predictable scoping behavior.</span>

          - In JavaScript, <b>data types define</b> the type of data that can be stored and manipulated within a
          program. <br>
          - JavaScript is a loosely typed language, meaning variables can hold values of any data type without
          explicitly
          defining the type. <br>
          <hr>
          - Use the <b>typeof</b> keyword to find a type of data or data stored in a variable. <br>
          - console.log(typeof(varName)); OR in console: typeof varName <br>
          - have a result of your data in a <b>table:</b> console.table([varName1, varName2, varName3 and so on])

      <div class="content">
        <p>
          <!-- --p-- -->
          In JavaScript, primitive data types are basic data types that are not objects and have immutable values. There
          are six primitive data types: <br>
          <hr>
          - <b>Number:</b> Represents numeric values. It can be integer or floating-point. <br>
          <span style="color: red;">
            let num = 10; <br>
            let floatNum = 3.14; <br>
          </span>

          - <b>String:</b> Represents textual data enclosed within single quotes ('') or double quotes (""). <br>
          <span style="color: red;">
            let str = 'Hello'; <br>
            let anotherStr = "NaseebCodeStudio"; <br>
          </span>
          - <b>Boolean:</b> Represents a logical value indicating true or false. <br>
          <span style="color: red;">
            let isTrue = true; <br>
            let isFalse = false; <br>
          </span>
          - <b>Undefined:</b> Represents a variable that has been declared but not assigned a value or a function that
          doesn't return a value. it is a data and also a value. <br>
          <span style="color: red;">
            let n; <br>
            let box = undefined; <br>
            console.log(n); // Output: undefined <br>
          </span>

          - <b>Null:</b> Represents the intentional absence of any value. <br>
          <span style="color: red;">
            let y = null;<br>
            let selecetedProduct = null;<br>
          </span>

          - <b>Symbol:</b> Represents a unique identifier, used primarily as object property keys. <br>
          <span style="color: red;">
            const sym = Symbol('description');
          </span>

          <br />
          <hr>
          <span style="color: blue; display: block;text-align: center;">These primitive data types are used to represent
            simple values directly in memory, and they are immutable, meaning their values cannot be changed.</span>

          <b>Types of Programming Languages:</b> <br />
          - there are two types of programming languages: <br>
          <hr>
          <b>1. Static programming languages</b> <br>
          - In <b>static programming languages,</b> the data type of a variable is known at compile time. Once a
          variable is declared, its data type cannot be changed. This means that variables must be explicitly declared
          with their data types before they are used. <br>
          - Imagine you're preparing to bake cookies. In a <b>static language</b>, it's like having labeled jars for
          each
          ingredient before you start baking. You know exactly what goes into each jarâ€”flour, sugar, etc. Once you've
          labeled them, you can't change what's in the jars. Similarly, <b>in static languages,</b> when you declare a
          variable, <b>you have to specify its type</b> (like saying this jar is for flour), and once declared, you
          can't
          change its type later. <br>
          <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">Example:</span> In languages like C, Java, or Swift, when you
          declare a variable,
          you explicitly state its data type: <br>
          <span style="color: red;">
            int num = 10; // 'num' is declared as an integer <br>
            String message = "Hello"; // 'message' is declared as a string <br>
          </span>
          <hr>
          <b>2. Dynamic programming languages</b> <br>
          - In <b>dynamic programming languages,</b> the data type of a variable is determined at runtime. <b>You don't need to
            specify</b> the data type when declaring a variable. Variables can <b>hold different types</b> of data
          throughout the
          program's execution.
          <br>
          - Going back to the baking analogy, in dynamic languages, it's like having a single jar that can hold
          different ingredients at different times. You can start with flour, then put sugar in it later if you need to.
          Similarly, in dynamic languages, you can <b>use a variable without specifying</b> its type upfront, and you
          can
          change what's stored in it during the program's execution. <br>
          <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">Example:</span> In languages like JavaScript or Python, you don't
          need to specify
          the data type when declaring a variable: <br>
          <span style="color: red;">
            let num = 10; // 'num' can hold a number <br>
            let message = "Hello"; // 'message' can hold a string <br>
            num = "World"; // Now 'num' holds a string <br>
          </span>
          <hr>
          <span style="color: blue; text-align: center; display: block;">
            In summary, the key difference is that in static languages, you need to specify the data type of variables
            upfront and can't change it later, while in dynamic languages, the data type is determined at runtime, and
            variables can hold different types of data over time.
